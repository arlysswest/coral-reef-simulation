### Research

## Research tools

- Chat GPT

## Debugging

- copy and pasted errors into chatgpt to better understand what the errors mean when I am unfamiliar with an error
- git revision control syntax for merging to resolve merge issues
- git revison contol syntax relating to braches

## Coral Reef Research

- ai suggested changes to ph, coral cover %, algea cover %, and water temperature when a problem or tool is applied based off what a realistic change in the statistics would be
  example: coral cover +5% when articicial substrate is applied
- ai suggested starting statistics based off of what realistic statistics would be
  example: coral: 35%, algae: 10%, temp: 27.0, ph: 8.1
- Ai suggested problems and tools that would be realistic for a coral reef
- Ai definitions for problems and rewards that are accurate for the problems and rewards I chose

## Game Engine Options Research
  - Determining which game engine to use:
  - chatgpt used for comparison & quick information
  # Bevy:
  - Built in Rust, fully free and open‑source under MIT/Apache 2.0. 
  - Supports 2D and 3D rendering, UI, cross‑platform (desktop + web via WASM) etc. 
  - Great for modern Rust game development with ECS architecture.
  - Note: still evolving, with breaking changes occasionally. 
  - Best for: If you want a robust and actively maintained Rust engine and plan both 2D/3D or future‑expand.
  # Fyrox (formerly RG3D)
  - Free, open source, MIT license. 
  - Supports 2D and 3D, includes a scene editor. 
  - Best for: When you want more “traditional game‑engine” features (scene editor etc) in Rust and are leaning toward 3D.
  # Piston
  - Modular open‑source Rust game engine/framework, started 2014. 
  - More lightweight and modular compared to engines like Bevy or Fyrox.
  - Best for: If you want to build something more custom/lean, focus on 2D (or simpler 3D) and don’t need full editor built‑in.
  # Amethist
  - Another open‑source Rust engine, MIT/Apache licenses. 
amethyst.github.io
  - Focused on ECS, 2D+3D support.
  - Best for: Historical interest or if you find legacy examples/tutorials using it. (But note: community momentum is stronger for Bevy currently.)
  TOP CHOICE: Bevy
